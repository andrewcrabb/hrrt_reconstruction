    \brief This module provides functions to convert sinograms into images and
           vice versa.
    \author Frank Kehren (frank.kehren@cpspet.com)
    \date 2004/04/01 initial version
    \date 2004/05/06 no arc-correction for acf from PET/CT gantry
    \date 2004/05/28 call IDL scatter code
    \date 2004/10/01 added Doxygen style comments
    \date 2004/12/17 added support for 2395
    \date 2005/01/04 added progress reporting to get_umap_acf() and
                     eau2scatter()
    \date 2005/03/08 fixed loading of u-map if GM is not initialized
    \date 2005/03/11 added PSF-AW-OSEM
